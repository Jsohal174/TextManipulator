Function 3 :
This function takes a string as its only parameter. It prompts the user to enter exactly n
valid positive integers, where n is the length of aString. Entering a 0 or negative is
considered invalid. The function then creates a new string that consists of the letters in
aString (in the same order) â€“ each letter repeated by the number of times indicated by
the user for that corresponding position.
